This jQuery plugin creates a forward compatible API for the new .on() and .off() functions introduced in jQuery 1.7. The jQuery team is moving away from the .bind(), .live(), and .delegate() functions. As a result, you may want to start using the new .on() and .off() functions now. This plugin maps the .on() and .off() functions to their .bind() and .delegate() counterparts.
